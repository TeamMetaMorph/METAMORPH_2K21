In this event, participants will enter a virtual portal and be provided with a challenge statement, as well as a plethora of seemingly everyday items. Using their knowledge about the properties of the materials the participants will have to pick one of the given items and then provide an explanation for how they will solve the task with the material in hand. Choose correctly and move onto the next level where another challenging statement awaits them until they complete all the rounds of increasing complexity.        ",

The player's character is a globule (can be either hydrophilic and oleophobic(oil fearing) or oleophilic(oil-loving) and hydrophobic, a player can choose any and has to stick with it. The globule resides in an emulsion universe i.e. a non-homogeneous mixture of oil and water bounded by the walls of the container. The player has to knock all the pins in the game (maybe throw them towards the wall so that they shatter).        ",
