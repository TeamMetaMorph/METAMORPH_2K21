              <p id="paratime">
                <br />The B. Tech. Programme in Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) started in the year 2017. Following this, Team Meta Morph was established by the first batch of B.Tech. MSE with the primary motive to facilitate novel interdisciplinary developments in the field of Materials Engineering and Materials Science both within the institute and beyond its walls. The name of the Team has its roots in the wonderful class of novel materials known as Metamaterials â€“ materials that showcase properties deviating from conventional standards. Our team had a distinct perception and vision. The desire to be unique in our endeavours has always been a natural disposition of the members of our team, and we proved the same during our first debut in NIMBUS 2019.

                January 2019 witnessed the official declaration of Team Meta Morph as a Departmental Team of Materials Science and Engineering. There was a certain zeal nucleating within the team, a zeal to participate and contribute. The prospect of representing the Department of MSE in a national-level fest for the first time seemed daunting, but also challenging. Nevertheless, we contributed our best, working constantly during both day and night during those critical months.              </p>

              The Interviews for freshers were conducted by the Executive Members. After two days of shortlisting, we selected our volunteers for the year 2020-21. We conducted an orientation for them before we started working. As the freshers were inexperienced, it was a tough task to teach them about the software that we were using and the technologies that we used in our projects. Our Executive members with their hard work and efforts were able to teach everything to the volunteers from the basics to the advanced level. They learned many new things and were excited to learn more.              </p>
